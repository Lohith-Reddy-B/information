# ABSTRACT

The rapid growth of e-commerce and digital retail has created an unprecedented need for intelligent product identification systems that can accurately recognize and classify products from images. Traditional product search methods rely heavily on text-based queries and manual categorization, which often fail to capture the visual complexity and contextual nuances of product identification tasks. This limitation becomes particularly challenging when users need to identify products from images containing multiple items or when they lack specific product knowledge to formulate effective search queries.

This project presents a comprehensive Visual Product Identification System that leverages advanced deep learning and computer vision techniques to address these challenges. The system employs a modular pipeline architecture combining state-of-the-art object detection using YOLOv8, visual feature extraction through CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) embeddings, and efficient similarity search using FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for real-time product matching against large-scale catalogs.

The core innovation lies in the integration of multimodal understanding, where the system can process both visual inputs and natural language queries to disambiguate product references in complex scenes. The system incorporates intelligent grounding mechanisms that can identify specific products based on user descriptions, spatial references, or visual prominence, followed by conversational response generation that provides detailed product information including specifications, pricing, and catalog links.

Experimental evaluation demonstrates the system's effectiveness in achieving high accuracy rates for product detection and identification across diverse product categories, with response times suitable for real-time applications. The implementation includes a comprehensive web-based interface supporting image upload, interactive bounding box visualization, and conversational product queries, making it accessible for both end-users and enterprise applications.

The results indicate significant improvements in user experience and task completion rates compared to traditional text-based product search methods, with particular strength in handling ambiguous queries and multi-product scenarios. This research contributes to the advancement of intelligent retail technologies and provides a scalable foundation for next-generation visual commerce applications.
